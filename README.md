# node-proxy-replay
Proxy to re-execute a new request with a set of custom headers.

Note: this is still under development and not fully functional yet.

TODOs:
 - ability to specify listening port
 - ability to inject custom values when posting form data (ex: anti csrf tokens, even tho some frameworks like Rails allows to specify this in a header)
